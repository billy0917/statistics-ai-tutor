# APA Style Statistical Reporting Examples

Use the following examples as the ground truth for formatting statistical results. Pay close attention to italicized symbols (e.g., *M*, *SD*, *t*, *p*, *r*, *F*) and the spacing around mathematical operators.

## 1. One sample t test
**Template:**
A one-sample t-test was performed to evaluate the impact of the mindfulness program. The mindfulness meditation program produces an anxiety score (*M* = 3.38, *SD* = 1.92) that is statistically significantly less than the population mean score of 6 (*t*(7) = -3.86, *p* = .003).

## 2. Paired t test
**Template:**
A paired t-test was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the fitness program. The results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference in the attractiveness ratings of Baby Face before (*M* = 3.8, *SD* = 2.04) and after the fitness program (*M* = 6.6, *SD* = 1.35), *t*(9) = 6.0, *p* < .001.

## 3. Independent t test
**Template:**
The results indicated that the mean time of the Own-name story group (*M* = 46.0, *SD* = 24.73) is **not** longer than that of the Ordinary story group (*M* = 29.36, *SD* = 7.16), *t*(6) = 1.73, *p* = .064.
(Equal variance not assumed)

## 4. Correlation
**Template:**
We can conclude that there is a (negative) correlation between stress levels and sleep quality (*r*(8) = -.99, *p* < .001).

## 5. Regression
**Template:**
The results suggest that the level of stress is a statistically significant factor in explaining 98% of the total variance in Sleep Quality.
(*R*² = .98, *F*(1, 8) = 306.95, *p* < .001).

## 6. Chi squared test
**Template:**
A chi-square test of independence was performed to evaluate the association between the type of coping strategies used and the reported levels of anxiety among college students. The association between these variables was not statistically significant, χ²(1, *N* = 80) = 1.45, *p* = .228.
